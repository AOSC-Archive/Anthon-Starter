# NOTICE: This is an example of the "md5sum" file in the AOSC OS ISO images,
#           which is used for Anthon-Starter to identify the validity of
#           image files, and hold an compatible with coreutils/md5sum.

# This following line is important: it points out the information of this
#   image file, which helps Anthon-Starter to identify whether this image
#   file is valid or not.
# Format (not including quotation marks):
#   "#ast-ident: [Generation] [Four-letter identify mark] [Live medium version]"
# NOTICE: NO space between "#" and "ast-ident"!!
#ast-ident: os3 live 20141207

# MD5 Checksums , just an Example, and CANNOT:
# - Change the sequence
# - Using text mode to modify them (will cause unknown errors)
# - Begin with sharp ("#")
# - Remove the head tag "#md5sum" (or Anthon-Starter cannot find checksums)

#md5sum
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456 *boot/vmlinuz
opqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmn987654 *boot/initrd
ab1cd2ef3gh4ij5kl6mn7op8qr9st0uv *live/live.squashfs

# Anything can be added if they're not begin with "# ast-ident:"
# And should be compatible with coreutils/md5sum
